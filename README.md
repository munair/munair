## Executive Summary

[I'm](https://hashnode.com/@munair) the chieft marketing strategist at [Infectious Content LLC](https://www.infectiouscontent.com/) (formerly Useful Coin LLC). However, these days I'm absorbed in the ever evolving [Striketarget](https://striketarget.ai/) AI project (a neural decision framework for options traders). It affords me the opportunity to **vibe code** at the intersection of equity derivatives trading and AI research all while enjoying the benefits of [Capoeira Wellness](https://www.instagram.com/contramestrezumbi/) and [Theravādin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theravada) [sīla](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qwl-bqy180Foo5kT7_ABpp3uPiv0hEdi/view).

## Building Defensive Systems

*Virtuous Finance* is a passion of mine. The term came to me shortly after a meditation retreat in Thailand and is driven by reading many works on money and finance, but chiefly on reflecting on the [magnum opus](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-Financial-Investment/dp/0471467146) of [Charles Poor Kindleberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_P._Kindleberger), [Fooled by Randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fooled_by_Randomness) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb (another thoughtful but vulgar graduate of my [alma mater](https://www.upenn.edu/)), the amazing [Lords of Finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lords_of_Finance) by the Kenyan [Liaquat Ahamed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaquat_Ahamed), and the immaculate [utterings](https://suttacentral.net/pitaka/sutta?lang=en) of the Buddha.

To that end I am developing institutional-grade trading technology that reduces unforced errors through systematic decision frameworks in options trading.

### Current Work
- **Striketarget AI**: Proprietary Neural Decision Framework for institutional options trading
- **Technology Stack**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Cursor
- **Architecture**: Dependency inversion principle driven, type-first functional programming
- **Philosophy**: Systematic error reduction through rule-based frameworks

### Development Principles
- Define types first, implement second
- Apply dependency inversion consistently
- Reduce cognitive load through systematic approaches
- Document decisions and trade-offs publicly

### Content Creation Plans

- **Substack**: Reflections on AI and trading systems
- **GitHub**: Open-source code snippets and knowledge sharing

### Contact
- **Email**: [chief@striketarget.ai](mailto:chief@striketarget.ai)
