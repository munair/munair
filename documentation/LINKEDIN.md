**Founder of Striketarget AI — an options trading copilot for professional traders.**

I design and build information systems at the intersection of equity derivatives and artificial intelligence. Striketarget AI is a decision support engine for institutional investors — integrating pattern recognition, volatility surface analysis, and neural decision frameworks into a streamlined platform that reinforces disciplined trading.

Previously, I served as Chief Marketing Officer at IO Trust (makers of D’CENT Wallets), where I led product positioning, institutional partnerships, and go-to-market strategy in the Web3 space. I also advise and direct creative at Infectious Content (formerly Useful Coin), helping mission-driven founders clarify their message and sharpen their growth strategy.

My work draws deeply from lived practice — Capoeira for health and wellness, and Theravādin ethics and meditation (sīla and samādhi) for discipline and equanimity. I believe that what you (cautiously) **don’t** do forms the foundation for what you **do** (excellently). I build trading systems accordingly.

**Current focus:** AI-augmented decision support for institutional trading desks.
